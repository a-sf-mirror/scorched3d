Scorched 3D - http://www.scorched3d.co.uk

Overview
--------

Scorched3D supports multiple platforms : Win32, Linux, OSX and Solaris.
Each platform requires different libraries and compilers.  The
following sections outline a brief guide to compiling.

If any errors are encountered please see the FAQ and Forums at
http://www.scorched3d.co.uk


Windows (Win32)
---------------

Compilation of Scorched3D is supported on windows via the 
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET compiler :- 
 http://www.microsoft.com/visualc
and the free borland compiler :-
 http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html.

To compile using Visual Studio .NET compiler :- 
1) Load the scorched.sln file in the base directory.
2) Choose build from the build menu.  No extra libraries are required
as they are all bundled in the source distribution.

Linux
-----
Compiling requirements  : 

 * GNU tools (http://www.gnu.org/directory/GNU/)
    aclocal (GNU aclocal) 1.6		[aclocal --version]
    automake (GNU automake) 1.6		[automake --version]
    autoconf (GNU autoconf) 2.57	[autoconf --version]
    GNU Make 3.80			[make --version]
    gcc version 3.2 			[g++ --version]

 * Simple Directmedia Layer (http://www.libsdl.org/)
    SDL 1.2.4

 * FreeType2 (http://www.freetype.org)
    freetype 7.0.1                      [freetype-config --version]

 * OpenAL (http://www.openal.org)
    openal 0.0.8  [openal-config --version]

  cvs -d:pserver:guest@opensource.creative.com:/usr/local/cvs-repository login
  (use password "guest")
  cvs -d:pserver:guest@opensource.creative.com:/usr/local/cvs-repository co openal 

 * WX-windows (http://www.wxwindows.org)
    wx-windows 2.4.2			[wx-config --version]

 * OpenGL (http://www.opengl.org) 	[glxinfo | grep -i version]
    server glx version string: 1.3
    client glx version string: 1.3
    OpenGL version string: 1.4.0 
    glu version: 1.3

Make sure at least all these are properly installed.
Any required m4 files are now packaged as part of the scorched3d
distribution.

Run the following commands to compile scorched :-

1) chmod +x autogen.sh
2) ./autogen.sh
3) make 
(on some systems build times can be reduced by using the -j2
flag for make)
4) make install (may need to be done as root)

If you are compiling from CVS or a development version and the
compiler complains of missing files at link time you may need to 
run the createAMMakefile.pl script in the scripts directory.
Do this before step 1.

By default Scorched3D will be installed in /usr/local/games/scorched3d.
The Scorched3D executable is called scorched3d and is located
in the bin directory off this directory.  

MacOSX
------
The Mac version has now been updated to be compiled in the same
way as the linux version.  See above.
Use wxmac instead of wxgtk to allow the user to run without X11.
