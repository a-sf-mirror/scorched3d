It's now possible to fix the price of an Accessory by setting the FreeMarketLimit of it to 0
The price of each accessory is calculated and stored exactly with no rounding, the rounding is only applied to the visible prices.
Removed the dependancy on returning char * from certain S3D APIs (for thread safety)
Most S3D global APIs are now namespaced into the S3D:: namespace
Updated directory structure to enforce server only builds (client directories are not added to server -I path)
