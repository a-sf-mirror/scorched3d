Scorched3D allows each mod to define a set of landscapes (or to modify the existing landscapes). 

Rather than being stored in a single file like the accessories, Scorched 3D's landscapes are spread out over a series of different files. Each file contains the different aspects that come together to define the overall result that you see in the game. 

Landscapes are defined in two parts:- 
1. The physical structure of the landscape. This includes details like how large the landscape and how hilly it is. These are defined in landscape definition files #url(LandscapeDefinition.html). 
2. The visuals/skin of the landscape. This includes details like what color the landscape is and how many trees it has. These are defined in landscape texture files #url(LandscapeTexture.html).

Each of these aspects (visual and physical) have a set of different properties that can be defined. 

Splitting these two concepts into separate files allows each different visual to be applied to all physical landscapes increasing the variety and combinations of landscapes. 

In addition to this documentation, a good way to learn to manipulate the landscapes is to have a look at what has already been done. In addition to looking at the standard files that come with the game, there are plenty of mods available to look through as well. Looking at as much of the xml as you can is a great way to get acquainted with the workings of Scorched 3D.
