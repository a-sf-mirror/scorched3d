Include files are a type of landscape file that provides two functions. 

First, include files allow you to access the settings available to you when loading server settings or by changing them manually. What this means is that you can use an include file to change things like gravity, number of teams, number of bots and weaponsize from within a landscape definition rather than having to adjust the server settings manually to achieve the desired setup for your map. 

Second, in addition to providing this new access to the server settings, include files can also be used to build ANY other type of landscape asset. What this means is, you no longer have to create your boids in one file, your ships in another file, your placements in yet another file and then reference them all separately if you don't want or need to. With the include type of file, you could theoretically create all these things a specific landscape needs in one file if you wanted to. 

Like most of the other optional landscape features, include files can be referenced from either #url(LandscapeDefinition.html) or #url(LandscapeTexure.html) files.

Include files are now essentially the single most power tool available to you when creating landscaped for Scorched 3D. They not only provide you with all new access to server settings that were previously not available to landscapes, but they provide you access to practically every other type of landscape asset available as well.
