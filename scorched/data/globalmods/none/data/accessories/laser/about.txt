Laser Weapon 1.4

About:
This is a tweaked version of the laser weapon primitive made by Gavin.

Changes and Additions include:
Cost/Bundle Amount Added
Longer Range (In some cases the laser would not reach a far opponent)
Longer Animation (1 more second to be exact)
Sound Added
Fixed Icon
Description Added
HUD model Added


Revision History:
v1.2: Added HUD Model
v1.3: Tweaked damage settings to more accurately reflect tweaked maximum distance.
v1.4: Reduced poly count and added slight transparency.


How the Laser Operates:
I was a bit confused on exactly how the laser worked but I soon later figured it out.

The shorter the laser is, the more damage it will do. This, of course, adds to the skill needed to use this weapon.

The laser will penetrate through mountains and shields.
