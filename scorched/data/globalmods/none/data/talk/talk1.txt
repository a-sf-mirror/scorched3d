I'll really miss you!
I'll always remember you...
Eat my shorts!
You're toast!
Banzai!
Don't take this too hard.
I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it.
3... 2... 1... Go!
Ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
The world will be better without you!
Go ahead. Make my day!
Somebody stop me before I do something crazy!
Oh, I am so cruel!
Attack!
You're outta here.
I'll teach you how to shoot!
Freeze, or I'll shoot!
Ha ha ha...
I was just playing with you before this shot!
In your face!
You won't leave this round in one piece!
I love the smell of Napalm in the morning.
Victory!
Oh, It's so good to be bad!
Show some respect.
Just who do you think you are?
Let's finish with this!
Knock, Knock.
Eat hot napalm!
Look over here!
This bomb will find you everywhere.
You shouldn't have taken my pen last year!
You are history!
Pay the price!
You don't have to return this!
Guess what's coming for dinner?
Merry Christmas.
Open your mouth and say a-a!
Here goes nothing...
This isn't business, it's personal!
Take it, this is free!
Blood, Pain, Violence...
I'll make your smile disappear!
Bend over!
I shall smash your ugly tank!
Smile please...
I wonder what this button does?
Let's see what are you made of!
Rest in peace!
Rest in pieces!
Say "cheese"!
You are going to die the hard way!
This is something especially for you!
Don't take this personally.
Would this make you mad?
On Which eye do you want me to hit you?
There can be only one...
I told you to leave my sister alone!
To be or not to be
My bomb is bigger than yours.
Don't forget about me!
Hasta la vista, Baby!
This is just your size...
Take this!
You are dead, man!
I'll taste your blood!
Try to catch this!
Don't move, stay where you are...
Kiss my bomb!
I can hit you with my eyes closed!
Your parents won't recognize you!
You leave me no choice...
I'll break your bones!
I'll make you very sick.
I can see you.
One bomb is better than thousand words.
I hope you have a life insurance policy.
Killing you will be a waste of a bullet.
I love hunting.
It is time for the execution!
I am your worst nightmare.
Try not to burn the grass when you explode.
I don't believe you.!
There are some things that money can't buy...
I have been waiting for this for a very long time...
I've got you in my hands!
You will have one hell of a death!
I keep this bomb for special occasions.
Sorry, but these are the rules of the jungle.
I just can't miss this one...
You are in the dead zone.
Only a miracle can save you now.
I forgot, what does a white flag mean? Ah, never mind...
I think my bomb likes you.
You and my bomb will be the perfect couple.
You are an easy target.
This is too easy...
I have some very bad news for you...
I will make you feel sorry you were born.
This is not murder, this is self defense.
This one should do it...
This will teach you a lesson...
Now you've made me really angry!
You are out of luck, loser!
Keep the change.
You asked for it...
Nice day, isn't it?
Don't forget to write.
Sorry, too late.
Believe me, it'll hurt you more than it'll hurt me.
So you were too proud to retreat?
Why do always I have to do the dirty work?
Sorry, I don't take prisoners.
This is like the old times.
It's too crowded here.
Meet my friend Mr. Nuke.
Just try not to scream, you might wake people up...
To me you're no more than a target.
That really got on my nerves.
My muzzle wants to tell you something.
Your problem is that you've got too many enemies.
You know what I do with trouble-makers?
I hate when somebody wakes me up!
You chose the wrong time and place to disturb me.
Do you want me to prove that I hate you? O'kay...
Disgusting, but it is a job...
This is unfair, this is dirty.  I love it!
That was your last mistake.
You shouldn't do that...
Without me, doctors would have no patients.
You have a pretty bad horoscope for this week.
Don't fight it, it's your destiny.
Do you need a doctor?  No?  Now you will...
Come on, doctors have to work too, you know.
No, I really insist you take it.
Can you believe I was a doctor two years ago?
Cooperation will make your death less painful.
Do you have a last request?
This is my day!
My parents will be very proud.
The things I'll buy with the reward for your head...
Ever tasted one of these?
I see killing as an art.
For me killing is everything.
I can't imagine my life without killing.
Everybody kills somebody in this world.
For me killing is like a drug.
I just have to kill somebody.  Here is the victim !
You have the honour of being my next victim.
Who is the next for the headache treatment.?
I was born to kill.
I just want to solve your teeth problem.
Take one of these, two times a day after breakfast.
You said you needed a Nuke - take one!
No, you don't need to thank me.
Let me help you...
Killing is fun!
Don't cry - my heart is cold as a stone.
Suddenly I have started to enjoy the killings.
Killing is my hobby.
War is like football, but whoever catches the ball, dies.
I hate people like you.
This is going to be a little disgusting.
I suggest you to close your eyes.
Move out of my way!
Take a deep breath...
This scene is not for children.
You don't know me, I can be a very nasty person.
Was that all you've got?
I am in a nasty mood.
I'm one of the bad guys.
You can't win with shots like the last one.
Look around, everything is against you.
The wind is in your direction.
Killing people like you is not murder.
People like you have no right to live.
You have the right to remain silent.
Sorry, the jail is too full.
The Earth is over-populated.
I am your angel of death.
From all the punishments I like death penalty.
You can find your own way out.
You stopped paying the protection money.
Defend yourself!
I gave you the choice.
Now it's my turn.
You are going all the way down.
You weren't even close.
You are not on my level.
Hell is too good for you.
Now you really got me mad.
I'm a killing machine.
You're not worth the expensive bomb I'm killing you with.
Who cares about your damn kids!
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.
Stop crying, I'm not your mother.
It's not just me - everybody hates you.
Don't worry, I have a lot of these.
Beer?  Vodka?  You want something stronger?  Okay.
Can't you feel it?
I'm not just threatening!
Stop playing games with me!
Just to show you I'm not kidding.
Give up before it's too late.
No more Mr. Nice Guy.
I'm raising it a level, no more baby missiles...
Be a man and retreat!
I wonder what were you hoping for?
You are shooting at me?! you must be crazy...
You are not worthy of being my opponent.
Unless you do something quickly, you are dead.
I hope you are not allergic to explosions.
You can't stop me!
I will continue doing this till you die.
You have bad tactics.
This way of fighting will get you nowhere.
You are leaving so early?
Don't talk to me like that!
I can't control myself anymore.
If there is a limit to how much you can take, I'll find it.
You can't keep like this for long.
I just feel I'm getting close.
I'm not responsible for what will happen now.
I don't understand that kind of joke.
You went too far.
Good news for me, and bad news for you...
You'll be dead like Einstein.
Wrong password!
I'll turn your lights off!
It's time to blow up your reputation!
Let me show you a nice way of losing weight...
I guess you'll be late for dinner...
I hope you don't have plans for the next thousand years.
I feel like ruining your plans.
You have a sense of humor.  You'll understand.
I said I'll not kill you? I changed my mind...
Try to run, I just love shooting moving targets.
You are the last one who saw me killing Jim.
Sorry, no witnesses.
You're going nowhere.
I'll bury you alive.
If you get lucky, you'll be buried ALIVE.
Try to escape, make my work easier.
You are on an open field, just like on my plate.
Hey, you, down there!
No one sees me naked and lives!
You didn't take me seriously enough.
This one is like what killed the dinosaurs.
Your life is the only thing I haven't taken from you yet.
You'll die exactly like the others.
You didn't die with the others so accept a private death.
This bomb is perfectly sterile.
Buy two of these and you get another one free!
This one is "on the house".
Everyone who opposes me will be destroyed!
I hate resistance.
I had a lot of enemies.  You'll join them soon.
This way of solving problems always works.
Let me show you a stronger argument.
This will help you decide.
I heard you are collecting bombs.
Let's shorten your life a little.
The rest of your life is too long for me.
This is between you, me and my bomb...
I kill for living.
Just remember, you started all this.
If you aren't my friend, you are my enemy.
Nothing can help you now.
Try to live with this!
I'll blow you up!
I always finish what I have started.
I want more!
You aren't going to get out of this that easily.
I don't want half, I want everything.
You still have something I want.
With enemies like this, who needs friends?
You are just helping me.
You are harmless as a fly.
You would miss me even if I was a meter from you!
You are playing like a blind man!
Let me explain this to you in another way!
I guess this is the only thing you'll understand.
This one you can't ignore!
Let me show you something.
Everybody knows I tried talking to you.
This will make you listen!
I'm sorry I hadn't done this before.
I will say nothing, my bomb will do the talking.
I'm mad at the whole world!
I'm so dangerous sometimes I even scare myself.
I feel I could blow up the world!
Everybody against me?  I'll kill you all!
Where do I get these crazy ideas from?
Every one of you will get something from me!
I'm undefeated!
Don't think that shield will help you!
I eat shields for breakfast!
You're out of fuel?  How sad...
I'll come to your funeral.
After I finish with you, they won't have anything to bury.
I don't need you anymore.
I'll start with you, and then I'll kill the others too.
Now I'll finish what I have started...
Enough with talking.
I'll take your life, you don't need it anyway.
Don't worry, you won't need your body where you are going.
I'll blow your brain up, you never used it anyway.
Too bad you did that, I was beginning to like you.
Do you know what I did to the last one who said that to me?
Nobody has said that to me and stayed alive.
Wish yourself goodbye.
You have finished writing your will?  O'kay.
You are still breathing?  Not after this one.
This one should do it.
Still alive? After this one you'll be sorry you are.
Still alive? Not for long.
Still alive? You're just making your suffering longer.
You can't avoid your destiny!
Enjoy the last moments of your life!
Let's add some action to this battle!
Look what I found in my ammunition box.
Killing for money.  I could've been rich a long time ago...
The undertakers will party today!
Go visit the undertaker.
The undertaker wants to know: what is your size?
Hurry up, the undertakers hate waiting!
I'll make you deader than dead!
Don't start fights you can't win!
You are doomed!
This will be your doom!
You can't resist the power of the Dark Side!
So be it, Jedi...
Give up, I am much stronger than you!
The Judgement Day is already here!
Pay for all your sins!
Go straight to hell!
Do you want fries with that?
Nukes don't kill tanks, tanks with nukes kill tanks...
Weapons don't kill tanks.  I do.
You're fired!
I'm a killer, like my father before me!
Your self-esteem is your weakness.
I have no need for you anymore!
Start praying!
Do you feel lucky, punk?
Who's your Daddy?
I've got a message for you!
Program failure, need to terminate!
Ctrl-Alt-Del for you!
I'll reboot your tank!
You tank is locked on. Please see your administrator.
I have a red targeting "X" written all over you.
Format C to your tank!
I'll turn you inside out!
Happy birthday!
That was your fatal error!
I'll abnormally terminate you!
I'm dominating!
DoubleKill!!
Headshot!
I'm on a killing spree!
Wait, wait, I've got another one, this one's gonna kill ya...
Your mother!
One bomb to rule them all!
Shhhhhh... Be wery weeery quiet, I'm hunting a wabbit.
Doomsday is coming!
Apocalypse now!
To die or not to die.
War is not a game, kid!
Fight for honor!
Sniper is my middle name.
Bond...  James Bond...
I came back for your soul!
Oh, really?
