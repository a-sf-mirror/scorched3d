It's now possible to fix the price of an Accessory by setting the FreeMarketLimit of it to 0
The price of each accessory is calculated and stored exactly with no rounding, the rounding is only applied to the visible prices.
Removed the dependancy on returning char * from certain S3D APIs (for thread safety)
Most S3D global APIs are now namespaced into the S3D:: namespace
Updated directory structure to enforce server only builds (client directories are not added to server -I path)
Changed landscape to use geomipmaps instead of ROAM
Removed option to have border heightmap around landscape (just make larger landscape)

Water LOD now depends on water mesh detail as well as distance
Added quadtree for water/land visibility
Started experimental splatting texture mapping for landscape
Started LUA scripting language support
Player dies when less than 1 HP (avoids 0 HP tanks)
Fixed tanks being positioned in the corner when joining at round begining
Added -startcustom option to server to start using default server.xml file
Added errosion and noise to options for landscape generation
Optimized collision space updates to be more efficient
Boids are now all grouped into groups of 5 to make flocking algorithm more efficient
